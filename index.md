Prof. [Juan Liu](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liujuan5) and Assoc. Prof. [Yulong Bian](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/bianyulong1/zh_CN/index.htm). And I am also a research assistant at Tsinghua University (THU), supervised by Prof. [Yongjin Liu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/~Yongjin/Yongjin.htm).

I'll joint HKUST as a PhD student in 2025 Fall, My advisor is Assoc. Prof. [Xiaojuan Ma](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/).

My research mainly focuses on Human-computer Interaction, Human-centered AI, NLP and Pattern recognition. To be specific, I am researching human-centered computing, aiming to better understand humans through the analysis of human-generated data.


## Research Interests

- **Human-computer Interaction:** user experience, virtual reality, ubiquitous computing
- **Human-centered AI:** EEG-based affective computing, flow experience computing
- **NLP:** sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, prompt engineering
- **Pattern Recognition:** video representation learning, action recognition
