# Baiqiao Zhang(张柏侨)

I’m a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by Professor [Xiaojuan Ma](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/). 

Previously, I was a research assistant at AI&XR Lab, Shandong University (SDU), supervised by postdoctoral fellow [Xiangxian Li](https://yibuxulong.github.io/), Assoc. Prof. [Juan Liu](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liujuan5) and Assoc. Prof. [Yulong Bian](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/bianyulong1/zh_CN/index.htm). I also worked as a research assistant at Tsinghua University (THU), under the supervision of Prof. [Yongjin Liu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/~Yongjin/Yongjin.htm). I received my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology in 2025 through a joint program between Shandong University (SDU) and the Australian National University (ANU).

My research mainly focuses on Human-computer Interaction, Human-centered AI, NLP and Pattern recognition. To be specific, I am researching human-centered computing, aiming to better understand humans through the analysis of human-generated data.
